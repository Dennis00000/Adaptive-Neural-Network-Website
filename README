## 🧠 Overview

The Adaptive Neural Network Explorer is an immersive visualization tool that simulates a digital consciousness. Each neuron represents different cognitive functions (memory, creativity, logic, emotion, processing) and the network learns and adapts based on your interactions, creating personalized pathways and discovering usage patterns.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Interactive Neural Network**: Click neurons to activate them and explore different cognitive domains
- **Adaptive Learning**: The network strengthens connections based on usage patterns
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamic animations and visual feedback for all interactions
- **Pattern Discovery**: Automatically identifies and tracks learning patterns as you explore

### 🎨 Visual Themes
- **Adaptive Theme**: Dynamically changes colors based on your dominant neuron type usage
- **Neural**: Classic blue neural network aesthetic
- **Cosmic**: Deep space inspired with purple and pink accents
- **Ember**: Warm, energetic theme with fire-inspired colors
- **Ocean**: Calming blue tones inspired by deep ocean depths
- **Forest**: Natural green tones with organic feel
- **Tech**: Modern digital theme with clean lines

### 📊 Analytics & Insights
- **Network Strength**: Real-time monitoring of overall network efficiency
- **Experience Levels**: Neurons gain experience and level up with usage
- **Learning Patterns**: Discover and track pathways between different cognitive functions
- **Session Analytics**: Track interactions, patterns discovered, and time spent

### 🔧 Advanced Features
